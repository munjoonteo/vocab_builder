#  Japanese Vocabulary List Creator

This app allows you to look up a Japanese word, save it to a vocabulary list and download the list as a text file to import into your Anki deck. It accepts English, Romaji and Japanese input.  

I am trying to deploy the site to Heroku now but in the meantime, run the site like so:  

```
cd server  
npm start  
cd ../client  
npm start  
```

This app is powered by the [Jisho.org](https://jisho.org/) API and made with vanilla React.
